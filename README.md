- 👋 Hi, I’m Kabelo, or @kabelom86. A kinda newbie to web development, but a web and computer geek at heart. 
        I've been a web surfer since the days of the 56K modem and
          I've enjoyed watching the growth and strength of the web and technologies to interface with the web.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web APIs, CSS, Javascript, Web Sockets, Linux, Stargate, Star Trek and all kinds of sci-fyee stuff
- 🌱 I’m currently on a journey of getting my JS skills to a comfortable level so I can continue to a frontend framework.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... (work in progress)
- 📫 How to reach me ... .
