- 👋 Hi, I’m Kabelo, or @kabelom86. A kinda newbie to web development, but a web and computer geek at heart. 
        I've been a web surfer since the days of the 14K modem and
          I've enjoyed watching the growth and strength of the web and technologies to interface with the web.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web APIs, CSS, Javascript, Web Sockets, Linux, Stargate, Star Trek and all kinds of sci-fyee geeky stuff :D
- 🌱 I’m currently on a journey of learning NodeJS, MongoDB, Express and getting my JS skills to a comfortable level.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... (work in progress)
- 📫 How to reach me ... (temporarily unavailable).
